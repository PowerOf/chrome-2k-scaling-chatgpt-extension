# chrome-2k-scaling-chatgpt-extension

This is a simple extension that increases the webchat size to accommodate a Full HD resolution for the browser version of ChatGPT on [openai.chat.com](https://chat.openai.com/)

Features:
- container size increased to 75rem if screen size is at least 1600px
- container max size restriction removed for window sizes above 1536px width

This is not licenced and is free to be distributed or used.

To use, download the code and load it as an unpacked extension in your chrome browser. 
If you need any advice on how to do that, do a quick google search: "load unpacked extension". And you will find more information on that.

No I will probably not make this available on the official extension store.
If it breaks in the future, I might or I might not keep this updated.
Yes it does work on my machine. If it doesn't work for you, the code might be obsolete.
You can try editing the page manually by right click - inspect and finding the element that is broken and try to manually edit the content.js to make it work for you.
